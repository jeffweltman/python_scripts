SetFilenameAsWorksheetName.py
  Required packages os, openpyxl

  This script will iterate through Excel workbooks in a specified directory and will set the worksheet name to match the filename. If the   worksheet name already matches, it will continue without changing. Optional print commmands are included to output the filename and       whether or not the worksheet was named correctly.
